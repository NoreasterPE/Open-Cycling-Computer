UI
1. Consider scroll-over-the-edge to switch pages
3. Control rounding errors when switching units in editor
4. New editor layout. Current is confusing.
5. Click to switch value i.e. click on temperature to cycle over min/average/max
6. Button maps with colour images
7. Indicate BLE connection on screen (WIP)
8. BLE device list expiry time. Currently never expires
9. There is no way to disconnect from a BLE device
10. Use real ff fonts instead of the "toy" cairo API

CODING STYLE:
1. Fix inconsistent naming: func, function, param_name
2. Formating might need to be unit dependent. Showing distance in [m] with decimal point doesnt make sense
3. Review & avoid try/catch. It's too expensive [HOLD]
4. Add a standard parent class for hardware module running in a separate thread (init, start, run, stop, get_data) [IN PROGRESS]
6. Add new params from modules to ride parameters? Modules to give ready for use values? Help standarisation, but makes splitting code into libs harder.
7. Define sensor module API (init, get_data, get_formatting, start, stop, get_status) [IN PROGRESS]
8. Make library for layout handling. Might be useful for other projects like weather station

REAL WORLD PROBLEMS:
1. Max speed will be false sooner or later aftera single invalid measurement. Kalman filter required.
2. Average cadence to be calculated for ride time (reset with ride time?)
3. Do not try to initialise subsystems too many times. If BLE/GPS/other sensor is not there it won't magically show up. Log error and give up.
4. Add a module to allow real live raw data monitoring
7. Use timestamp to discard false notifications BLE HR/SC
8. Use Kalman filter for speed - BLE SC goes crazy sometimes
9. Pulse heart rate icon every time ble notification is received
11. Make threads stoppable with feedback for clean exit (low priority)
12. Use Kalman filter for heart rate - ble_hr goes crazy sometimes
12. Use Kalman filter for cadence - ble_sc goes crazy sometimes

CODE ERRORS:
1. Threads write to log aftred log end [ERROR]
4. Setting time from GPS for the first time breaks delta (trip time)
8. Average cadence and heart rate are invalid
9. Errors when no bmp183 or gps present

HARDWARE:
1. Add backlight control
2. Is it possible to read date/time from GPS chip with no fix or a separate clock is needed?
3. Fix lost should be marked in log? {Yes, as DEBUG}

FUTURE
1. Make libaray for layout design? [IN PROGRESS]
2. Explore python-osmgpsmap

[DONE]
1. [DONE] Saving setting (i.e. current layout)
2. [DONE] Split module tests from main part and use consistent naming
3. [DONE] When bmp183 is not connected Ctrl-C doesn't quit occ.py 
4. [DONE] Add visualisation of clickable areas for easy debugging
5. [DONE] Editing units (selection list)
6. [DONE] Conversion table for units, start with basic km <-> mph
7. [DONE] Editing single digits in numbers

9. [DONE] Find a solutin to black square under hidden cursor. pygame.mouse.set_pos() ? - Solved with 90dbdfc0eb8f1b7ce115eee0e0f942bcdadb1c97
11. [DONE] Use this for rel_movement: >>> from operator import add >>> map(add, list1, list2)
15. [DONE] Allow for changing units of non-editable params like speed or temperature. Block edit in editor but leave unit switching?
16. [DISCARDED] Reading time since boot from gps? - there is no need fo this
17. [DONE] Logging to file to debug field test crashes
18. [DONE] Setup formatting for logger as per https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html
19. [DONE] Add more logging, dump ride params to log?

21. [IN TESTING - see MOD[20] Rare error on start

22. [DONE] Use for exceptions logging: Logger.exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)
23. [DONE] Add option for easy rendering icons, like a small image that is overlapped on top of background.
24. [DONE] Units switching for non-editable parameters
25. [DONE] Saving preferred units to config file
