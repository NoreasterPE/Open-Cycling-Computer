Use default.yaml as a template.
FIXME - list needs updating, now all external valueas are prefixed with [sensor name]_ i.e. pressure from bmp183 is bmp183_pressure

Valid function names for use in layout files (for now it's the best idea to check default.yaml file with default layout):

altitude		        - current altitude in meters, calculated from pressure
reference_altitude	        - home altitude
ble_sc_cadence			- cadence from BLE sensor
date			        - current date
distance
slope			        - gradient of the road
ble_hr_heart_rate
odometer		        - total distance, editable in Settings page
bmp183_pressure		    - current atmospheric pressure
pressure_at_sea_level	- sea level pressure calculated from pressure and given altitude. It's a value fixed at start or updated after user editied reference_altitude
rider_weight	    	- weight of rider
rtc			            - combined date + time 
speed		        	- speed, to be calculated using Kalman filter from gps + wheel sensor - not implemented yet (fixed value)
speed_tenths        	- first decimal place of speed
time	        		- current time
utc		            	- utc time as reported by gps unit

...and many more FIXME!

Units:
Each parameter from above list has to have an unit defined. The name has to be the same as parameter name + _unit
i.e for speed is is speed_unit.

Functions:
FIXME - udate list of functions
halt			- halts the system
quit			- quits occ
reboot			- reboots the system

Future:
altitude_gps	- altitude as reported by gps unit
latitude		- latitude as reported by gps unit
longitude		- longitude as reported by gps unit
satellites
satellites_used
satellites_visible
speed_gps       		- speed, reported by gps
