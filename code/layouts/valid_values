Use default.yaml as a template.

Valid parameter names for use in layout files (for now it's the best idea to check default.yaml file with the default layout):

Parameters provided by modules:
Module name   Parameter name:
ble_hr        heart_rate                        - current heart rate for BLE sensor
ble_hr        heart_rate_notification_beat      - indicate is notifications from the sensor keep coming. Every received notification flips the state between 0 and 1
ble_hr        heart_rate_device_name            - name of BLE heart rate sensor, as reported by the device
ble_sc        cadence                           - cadence from BLE sensor
ble_sc        cadence_notification_beat         - indicate is notifications from the sensor keep coming. Every received notification flips the state between 0 and 1
ble_sc        cadence_speed_device_name         - name of BLE cadence/speed sensor, as reported by the device
ble_sc        odometer                          - total distance, editable in Settings page
ble_sc        wheel_revolution_time             - time of last wheel revolution
ble_sc        wheel_revolutions                 - total number of wheel revolutions for BLE sensor 
bmp183        altitude                          - current altitude, calculated from pressure
bmp183        pressure                          - current atmospheric pressure
bmp183        temperature                       - current temperature
compute       real_time                         - current time
compute       session_time                      - time since the start of compute module
compute       slope                             - gradient of the road, claculated from altitude change and odometer change
compute       speed                             - ground speed, calculated from wheel size and wheel revolution time
compute       start_time                        - time stamp of compute module start
config        cadence_speed_device_address      - BLE address of speed/cadence sensor
config        heart_rate_device_address         - BLE address of heart rate sensor
config        log_level                         - logging level
bmp183        reference_altitude                - reference (home) altitude used to calculate mean sea level pressure
config        rider_weight                      - rider weight, currently not used
config        wheel_circumference               - circumference of wheel, calculated from wheel size (see wheel module for the details)

Parameters stored in config file:
config        log_level
config        rider_weight
config        wheel_size
config        wheel_circumference
config        reference_altitude

config        heart_rate_device_address
config        cadence_speed_device_name
config        cadence_speed_device_address

Parameters needed by modules:
ble_hr        heart_rate_device_address
