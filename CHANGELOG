v0.14
- Add ds18b20 1-wire thermometer plugin
- One-page-per-file layouts.
- Add rel_origin option, abs_origin option in page definition. Allows more consistent definition or repeated elements
- Add kalman filtered heart rate
- Add BLE services/characteristics scanning & logging
- Filter for devices providing required service, so user looking for heart rate BLE device won't see neighbour's TV set
- Add text alignment on point. Text aligned "on point" will keep the point (comma or any rightmost non-digit) fixed
- Code cleaning, formatting, typos, and hardening

v0.13
- More formats, units and layouts
- BLE scanning and device selection
- More flexibility in layout/plugin design with long_click and short_click calls
- Updated documentation [WIP]
- Approximate gear ratio calculation in bicycle plugin
- Graphical overlays to show messages to the user. Used for BLE scanning and battery status
- Pimoroni LiPo shim plugin to show battery status
- Split data dumping and writing to file to avoid file corruption
- Fixed problem with finger on the screen, but not moving (long click)
- Code cleaning and hardening

v0.12
- plugin methods can be linked to layout buttons, i.e short click on button runs method "do_something_awesome" from plugin "my_plugin"
- page text colour is now used
- list editor (select item from list) added. Used for wheel size. Allowed values are stored in config file
- Code cleaning, refactoring, decoupling and hardening
- documentation
- initial version of demo code how tu use pyplum (PYthon PLUgin Manager) to make simple weather station. See weather.sh (WORK IN PROGRESS)

v0.11
- added draft of plugins and layout API description
- added simple example of sensor monitoring (weather.py) with independent config and layout
- ride log defined in config file
- added plugins system, cadence resetting session distance
- fixed average heart rate calcs, added pounds to weight units
- use Gidole font, bug fixes, code cleaning and hardening

v0.10
- Odometer editable from Statistics, editors use zoom & colour, pressure sensor bmp183 replaced with bmp280 (kernel driver), bug fixes & code cleaning

v0.09:
- Change to notification system, code hardening and lot, lot of code cleaning

v0.08:
